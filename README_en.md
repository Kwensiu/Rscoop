## About

Rscoop is an open-source, lightweight, and comprehensive Scoop GUI manager project. The upstream author AmarBego is still actively maintaining and updating it.
My fork repository adds several features that haven't been implemented upstream yet, but due to extensive modifications, I don't plan to submit a PR for now.

~~It is recommended to use exe instead of MSI for installation.~~
We have replaced MSI packaging with NSIS, and recommend installing with setup.exe. A portable version is also provided.

Most features have been implemented, and there are plans to add quick installation of Scoop itself. However, Scoop installation methods are simple and diverse, so adding it to the GUI seems redundant.

## Features

Refer to the upstream repository documentation for already implemented features. Here we only detail the newly added features.

### 🌐 i18n Internationalization Support

<details>
<summary>Click to expand</summary>
<br>

Implemented project internationalization using [Solid-JS i18n](https://primitives.solidjs.community/package/i18n/).
Currently only supports switching between Chinese and English, and some texts may have issues.<br>

### 📲 Portable Terminal (In Testing)

<details>
<summary>Click to expand</summary>
<br>

Theoretically just PowerShell
Added automatic `scoop` prefix mode (toggleable)
When entering Scoop commands, you can omit the `scoop` five letters and one space. ~~(WHAT?)~~<br>

**Note:**
In some cases, the GUI cannot display certain error messages - this is a problem that occurs in various terminal-like interfaces.

### ✨ Better Package Information Interface

<details>
<summary>Click to expand</summary>
<br>

Added "Change Bucket" function to solve problems such as Bucket invalidation/renaming/debugging.

Added secondary confirmation buttons for "Update" and "Uninstall" to prevent accidental operations.

Also refactored the upstream `OperationModal`, which now supports minimizing individual panels.

**Note:** There is currently no solution for multi-instance minimized components. It is highly discouraged to run multiple Scoop instances simultaneously. Minimization is only for temporarily viewing other information.

### ⚙️ Scoop Path Auto Detection

<details>
<summary>Click to expand</summary>
<br>

The software can now automatically detect the Scoop path,
and check if the Scoop directory structure meets GUI expectations to prevent potential issues (not extensively tested)

>Located in the "Managment" tab of the "Settings" page

### 🔀 Update Channel Switching

<details>

<br>

For testing purposes only, mainly created for practice. Action workflows often give me headaches...

**Note:** After switching channels, you need to restart to correctly obtain update information.

### 💼 Rscoop Configuration Management (Testing)

<details>
<summary>Click to expand</summary>
<br>

Improved usage of Tauri Store plugin in the software. Data is now saved locally

Can adjust Rscoop log retention time and delete configuration and cache files generated by Rscoop
Will **not** modify any data of Scoop itself.

### ⬆️ Global Update Button

<details>
<summary>Click to expand</summary>
<br>

For lazy people, an animated "Update All" button will be displayed globally in the lower right corner ~~with a bouncy animation~~.
Of course, Rscoop has already implemented scheduled automatic bucket/software updates (added by AmarBego), so I've provided a toggle for displaying this button.

### ✨ Extensive UI/Structure/Logic Adjustments

<details>
<summary>Click to expand</summary>
<br>

Too many to mention here. Also, because of too many personalized settings, I don't want to submit a PR to the upstream.
Thanks again to AmarBego for providing Rscoop with complete basic functionality.
